# Bandcamp Breakcore Discover

A modern web application for discovering and streaming Breakcore music from Bandcamp with enhanced listening controls and quick navigation. Built for music enthusiasts who want to efficiently explore new artists and tracks.

## What This App Does

This app addresses the limitations of Bandcamp's native discovery page by providing:

- **Quick Track Listening**: Listen to featured tracks immediately without navigating away
- **Volume Controls**: Adjustable volume settings for better listening experience
- **Rapid Navigation**: Keyboard shortcuts for fast browsing between artists
- **Easy Link Sharing**: One-click copying of album links when you find something you like
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Skip tracks you don't like and move to the next artist instantly
- **Dual Mode Discovery**: Switch between "New Releases" and "Hot" (best selling) breakcore albums

## Why This Exists

Bandcamp's discovery page is great for finding new music, but their featured track controls are limited. This app provides a more efficient way to:

- Preview tracks quickly
- Navigate between artists seamlessly
- Copy album links when you discover something you enjoy
- Control volume and playback settings

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Q**: Previous album
- **E**: Next album
- **W**: Copy album link to clipboard
- **S**: Open album page in new tab
- **Space**: Play/pause current track
- **←**: Seek backward 10 seconds
- **→**: Seek forward 10 seconds
- **↑**: Increase volume
- **↓**: Decrease volume
- **Escape**: Close help modal
